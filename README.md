# Project Details
In this project, I had to clean, model, and analyze data to create insights to present to clients. There were multiple different datasets to work with containing different columns and values. The goal was to work around different focus questions in order to present data significant to the research question.
## Setup
The first step was to identify which datasets will be required to answer the business question- what are the top fice categories with the largest popularity.
The data cleaning occurred in the ReactionTypes-2.csv file as it contained multiple errors and null values that needed to be cleaned and corrected. 
    The data was cleaned by:
        removing rows that had missing values
        changing the data type of some values within a column
        removing columns that are not relevant
